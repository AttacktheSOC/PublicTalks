We invite you to join Greek Microsoft Security Community second first meetup for 2025 and third in a row that will take place online about "Artifice: Leveraging MDE's deception capabilities" with guest speaker Dylan Tenebruso (Attack the SOC). Dylan will elaborate how to enable and configure Deception capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and in less than 10 minutes create and deploy lures and decoys in our environment, misguiding threat actors and quickly identify suspicious traffic in our infrastructure.
